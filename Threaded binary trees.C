.....................
consider below given binary tree:
	   5
	.....
       10        15
     ....        ....

->In binary tree  more than 50 percent of link fields have \0 values
	and more space is wasted by the presence oof \0 values.
->The link fields(NULL link fields) can be replaced by the address of some
other nodes
-> This extra link is called as thread , the binary uses this extra links
