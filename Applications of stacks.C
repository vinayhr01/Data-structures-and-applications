Applications of  stack: Stack is having various applications. let us
conccentrate on Applications of stack
-> The various application of stack are listed below.

1. Conversion of expression :  when we write mathematical expressions in
 porgram we use infix expression, converting from infix to postfix,
 converting from infix to prefix and all other possibilites.

	       Types of expression:

		       1. a+b infix  expression (a and b are operands and + is operator)
		       2. ab+ when operator is placed after the operaands
			      postfix expression
		       3. +ab prefix expression


2 Evaluation of expression:An expression represented in the from of either
postfix or prefix can be easilyy evaluated using stack.
		      1.	4+6=10
		      2.	46+=10
		      3.	+46=10
3.Recursion : capcacity of the functon to call it self. Recusion is popular
application of stack
 -> The function calling is application of stack.

 4. Other application: There are many other application, where the stacks
 can be used
   for example: to find whether the string is palindrome or not,
		 to check whether a given expression is vaild or not.
